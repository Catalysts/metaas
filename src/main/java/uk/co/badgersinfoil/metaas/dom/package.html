<p>Interfaces defining the <em>Document Object Model</em> for an ActionScript 3
source code file.</p>

<p>To get instances of any of the interfaces defined by this package, use a
{@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.ActionScriptFactory}.</p>

<p>The top-level type is
{@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.dom.ASCompilationUnit}, which represents an
entire file (a 'unit of compilation').  Though a compilation unit, you may
access an {@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.dom.ASPackage} definition, and
thereby get to a specific {@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.dom.ASClassType} or
{@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.dom.ASInterfaceType}, which is probably the
thing of most interest.</p>

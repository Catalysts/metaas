<p>The <a href="http://www.badgers-in-foil.co.uk/projects/metaas/">metaas</a>
ActionScript source code generation / manipulation framework.</p>

<p>The key class in the framework is {@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.ActionScriptFactory}, which can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create concrete instances of the various interfaces the framework provides</li>
  <li>parse an existing ActionScript file into a set of metaas objects</li>
  <li>'serialize' a set of metaas objects back into an ActionScript source file</li>
</ul>

<p>Many parts of the framework may potentially raise
{@link uk.co.badgersinfoil.metaas.SyntaxException} on encountering invalid
ActionScript.  Note that this is limited to checks on syntax; semantic
checking (e.g. type-checks) is not performed.</p>
